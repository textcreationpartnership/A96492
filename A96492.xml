            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>I saw in a vision by night (whether in the body or out of the body, I know not, God knoweth) and lo a mighty black <hi>Bull,</hi> of most furious Countenance, rose out of the North, and came along in the Air, about a farlong distant from the Earth, directing his way in a very sturdy and swift posture, and with a straight course, not turning to the right hand nor to the left, towards the place where I stood (I being then in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;)</hi> and, upon his nearer approach, I discover'd one of his Hornes blazing with Fire; but the other I observ'd to be a straight Horne, partly black and partly white, in Rings: At the sight of which strange and formidable Apparition I began at first to be much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> from that faithfull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have lately had of sundry most strange (nay, I may well say <hi>miraculous) Rovelations</hi> touching my own private condition, being all of them <hi>most exactly fulfill'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> from that <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>perswasive</hi> Manner that these things appeared to mee in above <hi>all other</hi> either before or after them: And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se restlesse <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:120226:4"/> of Conscience,</hi> that have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied mee, untill I had now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated these <hi>Particulars</hi> to the <hi>World. For this Word was in my heart as a burning Fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I could not stay</hi> (according to that of the Prophet, <hi>Ier.</hi> 20. 9.)</p>
            <p>From this Subject, according to <hi>my</hi> Interpretation, from those <hi>strong Perswasions</hi> in my Spirit (under <hi>God's</hi> sacred correction) there are plainely denoted to us these <hi>Six</hi> Particulars:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That, whereas there came a black <hi>Bull,</hi> mighty and terrible in appearance, fromward the Northerne Parts to <hi>London;</hi> so there shall come in like manner a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>black complexion,</hi> and of an <hi>irefull</hi> and <hi>majestick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi> that is to say <hi>CHARLES</hi> called King of Scots, shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly come with <hi>a great</hi> and <hi>dreadfull Power</hi> from <hi>Scotland</hi> (as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:120226:5"/> is most probable,) or from the <hi>Northern Parts</hi> of this Nation, where He and his Army shall first Land, to this City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Forasmuch as this Apparition marced along betwixt the Heaven and the Earth, it doth most evidently promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate these <hi>Three</hi> things:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the said King shall not torminate his Designes on his own <hi>Earthly Interest,</hi> but on <hi>God's Glory</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. That <hi>high</hi> and <hi>magnificent Condition</hi> hee shall come in: And</item>
               <item>3. His <hi>Abhorring</hi> (as it were) to defile his Fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o with that <hi>Ground,</hi> whereon there have beene such <hi>Abominable</hi> and <hi>unheard of</hi> Cruelties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted since that unhappy time of his expulsion from his Native Countrey and Kingdome.</item>
            </list>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:120226:5"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> whereas it came straight forward, not turning to the right hand nor to the left, and in a stout and swift posture, there will arise from thence these <hi>Two</hi> Observations.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the said <hi>King</hi> shall not turne aside to besiege any <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty Garrison,</hi> or to sight any <hi>Flying-Party;</hi> but shall march directly on towards <hi>London,</hi> as the onely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Place of his attempts: And,</item>
               <item>2. His <hi>Policy</hi> in frustrating his Enemies Plots by a <hi>sudden Surprizall.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> by the blazing Horne is expresly signified that <hi>flaming Sword</hi> of <hi>Veng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ance</hi> hee shall bring with him; wherewith hee shall confound his Enemies, burne <hi>this City</hi> with Fire, and (conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently) destroy <hi>this present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:120226:6"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly,</hi> by the straight Horne, partly black and partly white, is to be understood that <hi>straight Rule of Righteousnesse,</hi> whereby hee shall square all his Actions both of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Iustice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixtly,</hi> and lastly, from the furious combating of these two Apparitions, &amp;c. I prescribe <hi>Thus;</hi> That the Inhabitants of this City of <hi>London</hi> shall draw out their <hi>Totall Powers</hi> against the said <hi>King</hi> and His <hi>Armies,</hi> and there shall be a most <hi>desperate Warr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This part is a large Negative description, what tender Conscience is not, then determining, (as the Doctor in the Chair) he tels us, It is a Proceeding, <hi>bona fide,</hi> without si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Respects or dissimulation; seeking, before all things, to know God; and fearing above all things, to offend him. This description (for it is not a Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal definition, as neither having a proper <hi>Genus,</hi> nor <hi>Differentia specifica)</hi> is as large, and wild in the Affirmative, as the other part was in the Negative; and thus M. <hi>Birchley,</hi> after his great strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings telling us (but confusedly) what tender Conscience is not, and not directly what it is, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves (for they are his own words, Page 14.) <hi>It is the only means God hath allowed our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to guide her Resolutions of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:120226:48"/> judging of others:</hi> in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t this Builder pulls down all the structure he had so artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built up before; for his posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were formerly out of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyed places of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Iames 4. 12. Rom. 14. 4. Who art thou that judgest another? &amp;c.</hi> And in this last clause the Sophister concludes, God allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the nature of a tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to the Resolutions of judging others: and this Pill once swallowed, other Physick is prepared, in the signs of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conscience; which he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons to be, Regular lives, no opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of self-interest, severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst corrupt nature, steddiness of judgement, constancy in their perswasions untill death, dying not only in, but for the faith; suffering all things to be taken away patiently, and for Christs sake. These are indeed Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:120226:49"/> Counsels, and great perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and well become all good Christians: but when the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of all these religious duties is more closely drawn to the Papists (as it appears in Mr. <hi>Birchleys</hi> a Dialogue with his friend, page 16.) the secreted plots appear more plainly, while it is insinuated, to please some parties, that tender Consciences have the power of judging others, Mr. <hi>Birchley</hi> quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termins that the Papists are the men of the Regular lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the end, if his doctrin take place, they must judge of all others; which is the present ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Popish usurpation, where it rules and reigns. As for the rest of the discourse of the tract of tender Consciences, it is a tedious deviation to other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; as a complaint against the former Oaths of Supremacy and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:120226:49"/> Allegeance, or the present Oath of Abjuration, in which mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring dislike, the Author fights most against himself, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding formerly for the Papists peaceableness, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And as for the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Papists more heavy afflictions than others, in the common calamity of the late Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars, it is a piece rather of Mr. <hi>Birchleys</hi> inclination to his party, than any reall truth.</p>

But that the three Questions may not pass without their Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, though briefly returned, <note place="margin">1 Resp.</note> It is evident (as to the first Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re) That although the blessed Angels had a more familiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity with men, and had a more visible conversation with them (as 'tis granted in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Old Testament) and that holy men of Old presented some venerable honor and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to them, as heavenly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Guardians, and Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers sent with some excellent news from God: Yet at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

               <p>This is an expression (if well observed) of near and familiar communion, such as the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs and Prophets, before the comming of Christ received not; the Angels acknowledging men their fellow Servants, and giving direction not to adore them, but to worship God. It is most true, that Christians are to believe the protection of Angels, the Devil denyes it not, <hi>Mat. 4. 6. Psal.</hi> 91. 11.

               <p>So then, in all this discourse there is no restraint of a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deportment in the Angels presence; nor a thankfull valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               </p>
               <p>2 As for the adoring of Saints &amp; Pictures, &amp; the distinctiōs of <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leia</hi> and <hi>Latreia,</hi> spirituall civility, and spirituall worship, they are but mincings of the matter, and inventions and traditions of men, willing to warrant with their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:120226:54"/> Learning and Wit, what they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not justify out of the Word of God. And if a voluntary humility, and will-worshipping of Angels, be a sin, because expresly against the canon of the holy Scriptures, certainly, <hi>à minore ad majus,</hi> it is most true, that adoring of Saints and Images is a sin more gross and more notorious; the latter being likewise expresly against the second Commandement of the Morall Law; which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist foreseeing, hath so mangled that Commandement, that it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth very lame; or so cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left it out, that, if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, the worshipping of Images should appear no sin, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, not Idolatry: of which crime they stand guilty, at it is too apparent to all the World, who view their Writings or their Practice in their deluded De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:120226:55"/>
               <p>As to the second Question, <note place="margin">2 Resp.</note>
                  <hi>Whether Papists be guilty of Idolatry in the Eucharist?</hi> It is most true, that no good Christian can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himself too religiously in the administration, or participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Communion of that blessed Mystery of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wherein the worthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth by Faith, really, and spiritually, feed on the Body and Blood of our blessed Saviour: But, for men in their subtilties and, and carnall wisdom, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure people to a new belief, that is, that Christ is not only really and spiritually, but corporally and transubstantially there; and not onely received by Faith and Spirit in the heart, but likewise tasted by the pallat, and digested, as other common food, this Doctrine is grofs and damnable. Another distinction <hi>de modo,</hi> that the Elements are changed in the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:120226:55"/> Sacrament, and the Accidents remain in the Bread and Wine, is as impossible, as irrationall. These doctrines and opinions are great errors, which usher on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warranted worship, which brings in Idolatry; which upon these unwarranted grounds is often committed: as, when the Priest is at the celebration of the Mass, and the <hi>Tintinabulum,</hi> or holy Bell soundeth, (as it alwayes doth at the elevation of the Host) then the People (though no Communicants) in the Church, are to fall on their knees and worship, being taught to beleeve, that not onely Christ is in the Sacrament, really and spiritually▪ but corporally, and transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially. Again, when the Priest is sent for to visit the sick, and comfort them with the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, having taken the Host out of the <hi>Pixis,</hi> or Box, in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:120226:56"/> on the Altar, he descending thence, is covered with a Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; and so moving towards the sick persons house, through the streets, Care is taken that the tinkling Bell sound all the way, untill the Priests return; which sound is to summon the People to fall down and worship as he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by <note n="*" place="margin">This is more than a civil &amp; venerable deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Priest in his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note>. There is yet a higher degree of unwarranted worship than these: for the Consecration of the Sacrament, and the Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sick, in themselves are pious and heavenly duties; but in the institution of the Feast of <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> when the Pope is carryed in Procession in greatest Pomp and <hi>Pontificalibus;</hi> And in all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique Countries the Priests and Clergy walk in solemn Processions, carrying the Host abroad to the greatest view and ostentation, At the Elevation and sight whereof, all
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:120226:56"/> spectators are commanded (if not voluntarily devoted) to kneel, and worship, and adore this great Innovation and Corruption to true Religion. (For it is neither warranted out of holy Scripture, nor imitated out of the examples of Apostolical and Primitive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, nor reasonably grounded upon any deduction out of holy Scriptures.) As it hath no great antiquity in it (being invented, and instituted about 400 yeares since, upon the Visions, or rather Dreams of two devout Sisters, Nuns, if the Legend speak true;) so hath it no solidity or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to invite or injoyn obedience, being in it self so scandalou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:120226:57"/> God, as they scandalize all good Christians; who in zeal and love to God, and his truth and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, cannot but condemne the whole Proceedings herein, as a work of flat Idolatry, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the <hi>Moderators</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to the contrary.</p>

               <p>And as for the pretended harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, quiet, peaceable dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Papists, in any Kingdom, or Commonwealth, where they have not an influence in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it is well known how full they are of plots and designs, dispencing with all obligations, to

This cannot but be yet remembred from the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> wherein the Papists (supported with the Soveraignty) were so actively and unmercifully bloody: as likewise in the long Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> against whom the Papists were so violently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, that some contrived (as <hi>Campian, Sanders, Parsons, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pez)</hi> to stab and poyson, her Honor, her Person, and her So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power. <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France</hi> tasted of the fiery, not quiet disposition, of the Papists; being most barbarously stab'd by a desperate <hi>Jacobin</hi> Fryer; and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> fell by the bloudy hand and knife of <hi>Raviliack,</hi> for which Regi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And although the poor Christians sit down in <hi>Turkie,</hi> resting quiet in a besotted ignorance, or a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed slavery, it is not because they wish not Revenge, and the yoke of their bondage not broken; but because the Sword is over them: and they have yet in memory, the violent and hard usage of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and Western Christians, who (raising Armies, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to relieve their sad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Turkish slavery) proved not Relievers, but Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors; and (being amongst them) appeared as great destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their content, their estates, liberties, and lives, as the very Turks and Tyrants, who had so mightily inslaved them, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom they enjoyed the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of some hard Conditions.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:120226:78"/> wretches (having minds onely set on mischief) nourished the seeds of their rebellious enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, with rapine, murder, and bloud; and (being neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of honor or worth, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding their Faith, or Oaths to God or Man, and being destitute of courage and valour, art, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and policy, to acquire their unlawfull and foul ends) they continue onely famous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious for their impieties; as having seduced many ignorant people, to become Murderers, Rebels, and Traytors, and have wilfully delivered up themselvs, and their own Countrey to ruin and desolation, to wretched and endless miseries; where the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Sword is not likely to be put up, untill the <hi>Irish</hi> Woods are dressed, and their traiterous Bogs dryed, and drained to obedience &amp; power of lawful Soveraignty.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:120226:80"/> their business highly advanced, their progress great, and their gain not a little, it they can but seduce and delude credulous Novelists to a dislike of that Religion wherein they were first baptiz'd, and seasoned in: and if they come so far as to shake the foundation, or to cause any to stagger, or totter from their first Principles, they conclude their own work half done. With such fallacies as these, have the <hi>Roman</hi> Foxes (cloathed in Lambs-skins) devoured many harmless flocks in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> having found out the way, by railings, and popular scandals, to smite and wound the vigilant Shepheards, and then to disperse and scatter the poor Sheep; in which amazement, and strange dispersion, many have run into Atheism, or desperate impieties; some have fallen into an Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,

But that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ignorance of some, nor curiosity of others, nor the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishness and protervity of many, nor the avarice and ambition of most, may prove prevalent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,

This Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical, Alchymistical Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler (long since) found out an easier way, by adulation, and Court-flattery, to get and gain, than by plain dealing; and that the streets of <hi>Rome</hi> were more smoothly paved for his purpose, than those of the City of <hi>York,</hi> or the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and that the Policy and Maximes of that Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> afforded greater helps and advantages to thrive cunningly, than that of <hi>England.</hi> According to the rules of greatest possibilities, this Rook builds his nest, and frames his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs; and finding his hopes in a more thriving expectation by his Inclinations and Resolutions to <hi>Rome,</hi> he quitted suddenly his Mother-Truth, and was easily tempted to rail at his own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Father, as an old Dotard, or ignorant Heretick, or a perverse
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:120226:82"/> Schismatick: And having taken the boldness once to dishonour such a venerable, and neer Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he cares not how malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously he spits at, and abuses all others, who would not admire his pretences to knowledge and experience, or not rashly submit and comply with his new opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and temporizing profession. And, as he hath no language, but gall and vinegar, for those who sided not with him, so he hath no drops (flowing from his deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful lips) but what were sweetned and sugarcandyed in gross dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation and flattery, for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded benefactors, and patrons; with these false Pendents, and counterfeit Jewels (Pedler-like) he addressed to many Courts, and to some persons of greater quality, both in <hi>England,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countreys; where he met with Ignorance, he laboured for
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:120226:83"/> admiration; where with great parts, and knowledg, he presently became an adoring Parasite: His Conversation was (for the most part) amongst Ladies (the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker vessels) on whose softness, and facility to nobleness, and bounty, he hath gained much, and made great use: perhaps, he would pretend to some petty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in Physick, and by this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, get a gold Watch, a Ring, or some such honorable toy, and reward of Flattery.

Fear, and Covetousness, are very ill Commanders, and lead on many ugly followers; their company is infectious, the design sinful, and the end very damnable.
